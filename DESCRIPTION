Description: 
  ISA-Tab (Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA) tab-delimited (TAB) format) is a
  general purpose framework for storing complex metadata in omics
  applications. It is notoriously hard to manipulate due to the fact that
  it is a graph rather than a tab-delimited data frame. The 'isaeditor' package is meant
  to facilitate reading, writing, displaying, manipulating, modifying and populating
  ISA-Tab files in R.
